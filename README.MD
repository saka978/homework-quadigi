# Homework task for Quadigi

## Description
This is a homework assignment for Quadigi Software Engineer Python (Test Framework) position.

## Project structure

```project/main``` - Contains all files that handle data sampling
```projects/tests``` - Contains unit tests to verify data sampling logic
```.gitlab-ci.yml``` - Pipeline script to run tests on CI machine

## What could be improved with more time?
- Code should handle invalid MeasType
- Unit tests should be expanded to test more edge cases
- Test data should be moved to seperate file
- Attach CI/CD runner to run those tests on gitlab pipeline
- Create requirements.txt when project grows, since it might require custom libraries
